# polaroid-cube-settings
An app to configure the Polaroid Cube on Linux, based on the info I found at http://eskerda.com/polaroid-cube-on-linux/

## Building
To build simply clone the repo and invoke `./build.sh` on it... you need the vala compiler installed (I used 0.30)

## Testing
Very little testing done... although I can safely say: "It works on my computer!" :p  
I tried on a couple of Ubuntus 15.04 and 15.10 and Debian 8... works like a charm.

## Roadmap
Upgrade my firmware and add support for settings found at http://hxy.io/polaroid-cube-hidden-settings/
